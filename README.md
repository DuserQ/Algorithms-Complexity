Hello everyone,
My name is Santiago, but can call me with de AKA "DuserQ". Here are all my projects, from the subject
Algorithms and Complexity in charge of the Professor Misael Diaz, a great person that havea a lot of pacience with
me, I know that i dont be the best student and leave my responsabilities away. but its not the correct way to solve them
so Im here face the reality and all the projects that didn't do it in the time that was proporsal.

Enjoy it and my big apologizes, Professor
